## Processing satellite imagery with AWS serverless architecture

This repo contains code and Severless Application Model configurations to deploy a serverless imagery processing pipeline in the AWS cloud.


### Install dependencies

In order to deploy this stack automatically [AWS Serverless application Model](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) is used.  An AWS account will also be needed in order to deploy the stack within the AWS cloud

### Usage


After cloning the code repository:

Navigate to the repository:
```
cd Imagery-processing-blog
```
Build the AWS SAM application:
```
sam build
```
Deploy the AWS SAM application:
```
sam deploy â€“guided
```

The current inference engine in the pipeline is Rekognition. This is commented out so you do not incur unexpected costs.
